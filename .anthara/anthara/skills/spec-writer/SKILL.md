# /anthara:spec-writer

Produce the regulated-industry spec — the anchor artifact every downstream Anthara command references. Slice-decomposed, categorically-framed, grounded in the platform's active compliance packs.

## On startup

Load deferred tools via `ToolSearch` with query `"select:AskUserQuestion,WebSearch,WebFetch"`. These are required for elicitation, external verification, and the closure loop; calling them without loading first will fail with `InputValidationError`.

## Operating principles

- **Outside-in slicing.** Functional requirements are vertical, externally-observable slices — never layered. `/anthara:develop` executes them in spec order.
- **Risk shapes grilling depth.** If `/anthara:start` threaded a risk hint (LOW / MODERATE / HIGH), the closure loop (Step 8) adjusts intensity:
  - *LOW* — light grill; one pass on the obvious unknowns; ship.
  - *MODERATE* — standard grill; press on vagueness, surface contradictions, verify external claims; the default.
  - *HIGH* — heavy grill; press hard on failure modes, error paths, rollback handling, edge cases, regulatory boundaries; spec ships only when uncertainty is honestly mapped to §11. NFR coverage in §6 is exhaustive across activated packs.
- **Categorical framing.** Requirements are types and invariants, not branching logic. The spec must let a competent engineer sketch module decomposition.
- **Compliance packs activate by context.** Load via `get_standards(<owner/repo>)`; surface pack-derived NFRs. Do not ask the user which packs apply.
- **Source attribution.** Every claim cites a numbered source. Any third-party API, platform, or standard referenced in 3 or more ACs gets its own numbered source in §2 with a `WebFetch`'d docs URL — not just the first one you happen to reach for.
- **Tool discipline.** Closed questions go through `AskUserQuestion`. One open question per turn; never bundle two.
- **Identifier style.** Hierarchical decimal numbering (`5.1`, `5.1.1`); flat integer source IDs; no prefix schemes (TR-, CMD-, F-); no Claude tool names in the artifact.
- **Drive to spec-readiness.** Classify each unknown as *checkable in-session* or *genuinely external*. Resolve checkable ones via the closure loop (Step 8) before writing. *"Not spec-ready"* describes external blockers only.
- **Expert facilitator.** Bring patterns, prior art, common failure modes proactively. Verify externals via `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`. Offer; do not impose.
- **Diagrams over prose where structure is non-obvious.** Mermaid for sequence, state, flow; ASCII for screens. Inline at the relevant slice or section.
- **Code in specs shows contracts, not logic.** Small indicative code is fine — API shapes, data structures, type signatures, JSON payloads. Logic-level code is forbidden; that's `/anthara:develop`'s job. *"`POST /api/orders` → `{ orderId, total, status }`"* belongs in a spec; *"`const order = await db.insert(...)`"* does not.
- **Architecture is a deliberate choice, not emergent.** Pick an architectural style by name from the recognized set — layered / hexagonal / onion / clean / DDD / event-driven / CQRS / microservices / modular monolith / SOA / pipe-and-filter / actor / space-based / serverless / micro-frontends. Justify the choice from the requirements and tech stack. A spec without a named architectural style has not actually chosen one — it has deferred the decision to whoever writes the first module. Tech-stack choices and architecture choices are coupled (Supabase + edge functions naturally ⇒ serverless; NestJS naturally ⇒ modular monolith; AWS Lambda + EventBridge ⇒ event-driven) — ask for tech, then recommend architecture.
- **Don't ask what you can explore.** Any question the codebase, git history, fabric memory, or `WebFetch` can resolve is resolved by tool use first. The user's attention is reserved for things only they know — preferences, intent, business context not present in any file or remote source.
- **Recommend with every closed question.** Every `AskUserQuestion` carries an inline recommendation — one option flagged with the reason in the question prose (*"I'd pick this because..."*). The user disagrees with one tap. Opinionated default beats neutral choice paralysis.
- **Lazy artifact creation.** Side-files (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `BOUNDARIES.md`, `design.md`, ADRs) materialize only when there's a concrete thing to write into them — never pre-emptive empty placeholders at session start. Capture state as it crystallizes, not on a schedule.
- **Spec carries intent; context file carries execution intelligence.** The spec captures *what the user wants*: types, invariants, ACs, NFRs, architecture, slice ordering. It does NOT carry slice imitation targets, slice-specific lexicons, or slice traps — those are derived from the *current* codebase by `code-orienteer` at `/anthara:develop` time, and live in the task-context file (`docs/specs/<NNN>-<slug>-context.md` §4a/4b/4c). Resist the urge to bake imitation references or trap lists into the spec: they go stale faster than the spec does, they bloat the document, and they belong with the agent that regenerates them on HEAD shift. The spec stays lean; the context file carries the slice-specific intelligence the executor needs.

## Fabric integration

When fabric MCP is reachable, spec-writer is stateful across sessions and projects via prefix-tagged entries in fabric's shared memory (see `docs/fabric-adoption.md` for the full convention).

**Emission moments — write structured entries when a decision locks:**

- **Step 4 architecture probe — on style lock:** `add_shared_memory("[ARCHITECTURE <project> style=<X> rationale=<Y> outcome=in-progress]")`. One per project. `<project>` is the `owner-repo` slug from `git remote get-url origin`.
- **Step 6 slicing — on module-boundary lock:** for each module whose ownership and interaction pattern is decided, `add_shared_memory("[BOUNDARY <project> module=<X> owns=<Y> interacts-via=<Z> with=<W>]")`.
- **Step 4 design probe — on canonical token / pattern:** `add_shared_memory("[DESIGN-TOKEN <project> token_type=<X> name=<Y> value=<Z>]")` or `[DESIGN-PATTERN <project> name=<X> used-for=<Y>]`.
- **Step 8 closure loop — on slice decision-lock meeting the three-criterion ADR threshold (D3):** `add_shared_memory("[DECISION <project> slice=<id> chose=<X> why=<Y>]")`. High threshold; don't emit Decision entries for every slice — only when the three-criterion test passes (hard-to-reverse + surprising-without-context + real-trade-off).

**Query moments — read prior org context before proposing:**

- **Step 4 architecture probe — before proposing a style:** `search_facts("[ARCHITECTURE", limit=20)` to surface prior org architectures + outcomes. Cite count and closest match in the recommendation.
- **Step 6 slicing — before locking module boundaries:** `search_facts("[BOUNDARY module=<X>", limit=10)` per module to surface prior ownership patterns.
- **Step 4 design probe — before proposing tokens:** `search_facts("[DESIGN-TOKEN")` and `search_facts("[DESIGN-PATTERN")` to surface canonical tokens / patterns and any prior deviations.
- **Step 8 closure loop — when a similar question recurs:** `search_facts("[DECISION slice=<topic>")` to cite prior decisions.

Skip both emission and queries silently when fabric is unreachable; the spec still synthesizes from session decisions.

## Step 1: Detect entry point

- *From a discovery brief* — read it first; inherit ontology, sources, findings, regulatory signals.
- *From scratch* — run focused elicitation (Step 4).
- *From an existing spec* — decide with the user: revise (overwrite) or extend (append slices).

If ambiguous, ask via `AskUserQuestion` before doing anything else.

**Capture risk hint.** If the invocation context note from `/anthara:start` contains `RISK=LOW`, `RISK=MODERATE`, or `RISK=HIGH`, record it; it scales Step 8's grilling depth per the Operating principle. Default MODERATE when absent.

## Step 2: Load platform context

The plugin bundles the fabric MCP. Always:

- `load_context()` — user profile, org knowledge, recent memories.
- `search_facts("<feature area>")` — surface prior decisions; cite as numbered sources.
- In a repo: `get_standards(<owner/repo>)` (parsed from `git remote get-url origin` as `owner/repo`; never `ORG_WIDE`). Inject pack rules verbatim before generating any requirement.

If fabric is unreachable, note it in Open Questions and proceed in corpus-only mode — never silently skip.

## Step 3: Read codebase context if in a repo

Scan top-level docs (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`), stack and module layout, constraints visible in code (auth, data model, regulated annotations, feature flags). Cite specific modules when proposing slices; check existing code when proposing invariants.

**Detect design state** (same classification as discovery's Step 2, same stack-agnostic signals — look for the *role* each file plays, not the specific framework): greenfield (no UI source files, no design docs), brownfield (UI source files present, no formal design doc or authoritative token/theme file), brownfield-with-system (`design.md` exists or an authoritative token/variable file is present). This routes Step 4's design context handling. If a `Design state` field is present in the context note from `/anthara:start`, inherit it directly — do not re-detect.

**Detect architecture state.** Scan the project's build/dependency manifests (whatever format the stack uses), framework conventions observable from directory layout and import patterns, and existing module structure. Look for `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, or similar.

- *Greenfield* — no tech stack chosen yet; no architectural pattern observable. Step 4 will probe.
- *Brownfield* — tech stack visible from the project layout; architectural pattern detectable from directory structure and module conventions (e.g., feature-per-directory, layers-per-directory, domain grouping). No formal `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- *Brownfield with architecture* — `ARCHITECTURE.md` exists and names the style; cite it as a numbered source and inherit verbatim.
- *Ambiguous* — tech stack visible but pattern unclear. Ask the user once.

## Step 4: Run focused elicitation

Spec-writer extracts structure; it does not redo discovery.

- **From a discovery brief:** open with a 3-5 bullet summary of what you're pulling forward. Then one open question: *"What's missing or wrong before I build the spec?"*
- **From scratch:** open in plain text — *"What are you building? Who is it for? What problem does it solve?"* Then one `AskUserQuestion` for pack-activation hints (multi-select): *touches patient data / involves clinical decisions / touches payment data / has user-facing UI / none / not sure*.

**Cross-domain simplification probe (run once at the discovery → spec handoff).** Before moving to deeper elicitation or slicing, ask one open question: *"Is there a small product or UX change that would eliminate a class of technical complexity here?"* The brainstorming lens applied once at the right boundary — a small product variation can collapse an architectural layer; a UX shift can remove a whole class of edge cases. Most of the time the answer is "no, the framing is right" — that's fine. When the answer is yes (the user surfaces a real simplification candidate), invoke `/anthara:brainstorm` via the `Skill` tool with the simplification as the topic and `caller=spec-writer` as a hint. Brainstorm explores the alternative; spec-writer restarts Step 4 elicitation against the chosen direction.

**Deepening (one open question per turn, only when needed):**

- *"What kinds of users / data / events / states exist here?"*
- *"What must always be true regardless of state?"*
- *"What happens when this fails?"*
- *"How would you know it works from outside the system?"*
- *"What would you not want to build but might have to?"*

Bring expert knowledge in. Verify externals with `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` — each fetched URL becomes a numbered source.

**Pull Design context.** Check in this priority order: (1) `Design direction` field in the `/anthara:start` context note — if populated, inherit it and skip any probe; (2) `Design context` theme under §5 Findings of the discovery brief — read it; the spec inherits direction. UI slices reference design tokens / patterns from this context in their mockups and ACs.

If neither source has design direction (older brief, no context note, or both set to "none — probe skipped"), and the project touches a UI, run an inline design probe before writing UI slices. Use the same dual-mode logic as discovery's design probe:

- *Greenfield* — short interview about references, density, tone, mode, motion, accessibility, worst-case environment. ~5-7 turns; per-turn budget; expert-designer voice.
- *Brownfield* — scan the codebase for framework, component library, theme files, color palette, dominant patterns. Summarize, confirm direction with the user, capture anti-patterns and don'ts.
- *Brownfield-with-system* — read `design.md` (or theme/tokens file) and inherit verbatim; ask only if drift appears in the codebase.

Capture the result inline in §1 Overview or as part of §3 Type ontology context — do not invent a new spec section.

If a `design.md` file exists at repo root or `/docs`, cite it as a numbered source in §2 and reference it from UI-touching slices.

**Feature-level layout probe (always, when the feature touches UI).** Even when `design.md` exists or design context is inherited from the brief, the *layout of THIS feature* has not been decided — the design system is system-level; layout is feature-level. Probe explicitly via `AskUserQuestion` (one or two calls, multiple questions per call):

- Primary surface shape: *list / table / cards / split-pane / canvas / kanban / other*.
- Secondary navigation: *top tabs / sidebar / breadcrumb / none*.
- Detail-view treatment: *side-panel / full-page / modal / inline expand*.
- Filter / search placement: *sidebar / top bar / inline / none*.
- Empty / loading / error state shape: *minimal / spotlight / illustration*.
- Density: *match design.md default / dense / generous*.

For novel surfaces with no obvious template (e.g., an entirely new product area), add one open question: *"What's the simplest layout that could plausibly work? Name two products with adjacent shapes."*

The answers feed slice mockups (ASCII screen layouts) and AC specifics. Inheriting design tokens from `design.md` does not exempt the skill from probing layout.

**Probe tech stack and architectural style.** Architecture is a deliberate decision (see operating principles). Run a focused probe based on the architecture state detected in Step 3.

*Greenfield* — ask about tech choices first, then propose the architecture aligned with those choices and the spec's requirements:

1. `AskUserQuestion` for the major tech dimensions, one tool call carrying multiple questions. **Derive the candidate options from what you observed in Step 3 and the domain the spec describes** — do not hard-code a fixed universal list. Offer the 3-4 most likely choices for this project's context, plus "other." For example: if the project is a Python data pipeline, surface Python runtime options first; if it's a mobile app, surface mobile runtimes; if it's a web API with no stack signals, surface a broad set. Dimensions to cover:
   - Backend runtime / framework (derive from context).
   - Database / persistence (derive from context).
   - Hosting / deploy target (derive from context).
   - Auth mechanism (derive from context).
2. From the answers + the spec's requirements (scale, slice independence, regulated content, real-time / async needs), recommend an architectural style by name. Justify in 2-3 sentences. Examples:
   - Supabase + edge functions + Postgres ⇒ *serverless / FaaS with RLS-as-authorization*.
   - NestJS + Postgres + monolith hosting ⇒ *modular monolith with layered intra-module structure*.
   - AWS Lambda + EventBridge + DynamoDB ⇒ *event-driven*.
   - Heavy domain logic + multiple actors ⇒ *DDD with hexagonal ports*.
3. Surface trade-offs as you propose. *"Modular monolith keeps deploy simple but couples scaling; serverless inverts that. Given the substrate-not-product positioning and per-tenant Recall workspace, I'd lean modular monolith. Match?"* — `AskUserQuestion`. If the user signals real uncertainty (multiple styles seem viable, the trade-off isn't decisive), invoke `/anthara:brainstorm` via the `Skill` tool with `caller=spec-writer` and the candidate styles as the topic. Brainstorm explores the candidates in depth in the same conversation; spec-writer resumes against the chosen style.
4. Once confirmed, draft the **architecture diagram** (mermaid `graph` or `C4` style) showing the chosen style's module boundaries and dependency direction. This goes in §7.

*Brownfield (without architecture doc)* — extract the de-facto style from the codebase:

1. Summarize the observable structure in stack-neutral terms: how features are grouped (by domain, by layer, by type), what the module boundary looks like, what the dependency direction is. Then propose the closest named architectural style and confirm. *"Match?"* — `AskUserQuestion`.
2. Confirm or correct. Capture banned anti-patterns the user calls out (e.g., *"no shared mutable singletons", "no controllers calling other controllers"*).
3. Inherit the de-facto style for new slices; deviation requires explicit justification in the slice.

*Brownfield with `ARCHITECTURE.md`* — read it, summarize, ask only if the codebase shows drift.

The result lands in §7 of the spec (renamed from "Architecture seeds" to "Architecture") with a named style, justification, and a diagram.

**Implementation-approach probe.** Architecture answers *"what's the style?"*; implementation approach answers *"how is THIS feature built?"* — at the level above per-slice code but below architectural style. Probe explicitly via `AskUserQuestion` (one or two calls, multiple questions per call):

- Real-time updates: *not needed / polling / SSE / WebSocket*.
- Pagination model: *cursor / offset / infinite scroll / no pagination needed*.
- State management on the client: *server-driven (refetch) / cached (TanStack / RTK / SWR) / hybrid*.
- Form handling (when forms touch UI): *library (react-hook-form / Formik / etc.) / native / custom*.
- Background work (when async / long-running operations are involved): *inline / queue (BullMQ / SQS / etc.) / cron / Temporal*.

For features with unusual constraints (high concurrency, large payloads, real-time multi-actor, cross-region), add one open question: *"What's the heaviest implementation decision you want locked in before slice writing? Anything that, if we get wrong, costs a rewrite?"*

These decisions shape slice ACs (e.g., pagination model determines AC 5.3.1's contract; real-time choice determines whether slice 5.4 has a poll loop or a subscription). Lock them in here; the slices reference them without re-deciding.

## Step 5: Build the type ontology and invariants

Two structures must be in place before slicing:

- **Type ontology** — kinds of users, data, events, states. Categorical, non-overlapping, drawn from corpus.
- **Invariants** — non-trivial system-wide truths. *"Every appointment has exactly one clinician and one patient"* is an invariant; *"data is consistent"* is not.

Slices touch types and preserve invariants.

## Step 6: Decompose into outside-in slices

Each slice is a vertical, externally-observable unit, sequenced for build (skeleton or happy path first, then alternates, errors, edges). Compliance ACs ride alongside functional ones.

Each slice carries: a verb-led name, a one-paragraph outside-in description, five metadata fields (Touches types / Preserves invariants / Affected modules / Active packs / **Reachability**), ACs as a markdown checklist (`- [ ] **5.1.1** <text>`) so they can be ticked off as `/anthara:develop` lands them, a **Verification block** describing how to confirm the slice works end-to-end (see below), and an inline diagram where helpful (ASCII for UI, mermaid for sequences and state changes). See `references/canonical-spec-skeleton.md` for the exact shape.

**Verification block per slice.** After the AC checklist, emit a 3-4 step Verification block written in stack-agnostic shape language — never specific commands, file names, or routes. Always include a "Run the full test suite" step. Include the migrations step when the slice changes schema. Include the user-facing-flow and accessibility steps (both driven through the `chrome-devtools-mcp` browser session) when the slice has any UI surface; omit both for pure backend or MCP-only slices. The exact wording lives in `references/canonical-spec-skeleton.md`'s slice template — use it verbatim. The point is to capture what "slice complete" means operationally, not to predict file names that don't exist yet.

**Reachability — the wiring contract.** Each slice declares one or more Reachability lines of the form `<Host> → <Entry>`. The Entry is the outermost user-reachable thing the slice exposes (a screen, button, CLI subcommand, HTTP endpoint, webhook subscriber, scheduled job). The Host is the surface that contains the Entry — name an earlier slice's Entry verbatim, or write `root` for the legitimate first surfaces (the app shell, the CLI entry point, the public API root). When the same Entry is reachable from multiple Hosts, write one line per Host. These lines turn slice ordering into a mechanical dependency graph rather than a narrative — the next instruction in this step uses them.

**Order slices by the surface-DAG.** Draft the slice list internally first, then derive the order mechanically from the Reachability lines: build a directed graph where each slice points to the slice that owns the Host on each of its Reachability lines (a slice with `root` on the left depends on nothing); topologically sort. Slices with `root` come first; every other slice is ordered after every slice it depends on. A cycle or a dangling Host (one that doesn't match any earlier slice's Entry verbatim, and isn't `root`) is a spec defect — resolve it before surfacing the order to the user. The topo-sort is the proposed build order; the user verifies each slice as `/anthara:develop` builds it, so the order IS the verification sequence.

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:

- *Confirm proposed order:* the topo-sort of the surface-DAG (root surfaces first → slices that attach to them → slices that attach to those).
- *Adjust the order:* user supplies a new order in a follow-up open question. Any change must still respect the DAG — a slice cannot be moved ahead of a Host it depends on.
- *Split or merge slices:* when granularity is off — *"slice 5.2 is doing too much; want to split into 5.2 and 5.3?"*

The order is the build sequence. `/anthara:develop` executes slices strictly in this order, one at a time. Decide order deliberately here; reordering after develop runs is expensive.

**No forward references in slice prose.** Before surfacing the spec, scan slice descriptions and AC text for patterns like `(slice 5.X)` or `see slice 5.X` where 5.X appears *after* the current slice in the order. Each match is a defect: either reword to remove the reference, or move the referenced slice earlier (which it should already be, if its Entry is genuinely a Host of the current slice). This lint catches the exact failure mode that produced the Lane spec's unreachable-feature cascade — slice 5.14's AC saying *"Detail view (slice 5.15) shows..."* when 5.15 hadn't been built yet.

**Effort/Risk evaluation pass (MODERATE/HIGH risk only).** When the risk hint is MODERATE or HIGH, group slices by effort (small / medium / large) and risk (low / med / high) before locking the order. Surface a one-line summary — *"Slices 5.1, 5.2 are small/low; slice 5.3 is large/high (Recall.ai integration with no idempotency); slices 5.4-5.7 are medium/medium."* If the DAG order concentrates risk in early slices, propose one wildcard reorder via `AskUserQuestion`: *"Slice 5.3 is the highest-risk piece. Tackle it first to surface failures early, or keep the DAG order?"* Any reorder must still respect the surface-DAG — a slice cannot be moved ahead of a Host it depends on. LOW risk skips this pass.

**Three-criterion ADR threshold (in-spec decisions).** When a slice locks a choice that meets ALL THREE criteria, propose a slice-level ADR alongside the slice:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful (data migration, contract change, breaking change to downstream consumers).
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder *"why did they do it this way?"*.
3. **Result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons.

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Threshold is intentionally high — don't ADR-spam. Propose at most one ADR per slice. ADRs live at `docs/adr/<NNNN>-<slug>.md` (one per file, decision-numbered) when the project has an ADR convention, or reference from spec §11 when it doesn't.

## Step 7: NFRs & regulatory compliance

NFRs and regulatory controls are two views of the same pack-derived material — combine into one spec section. For each activated pack:

- List the pack rules from `get_standards()` that apply to this spec.
- State the resulting NFRs (encryption, audit logging, retention, accessibility levels, threat-model concerns).
- Cite control IDs where applicable (HIPAA §164.x, PCI Req. y, SOC 2 CCx.y, WCAG SC w.x.y).
- Build a control coverage matrix mapping each control to slices and committed evidence.

Confirm pack-derived NFRs feel right via one `AskUserQuestion`. Do not ask which packs apply — the platform tells us.

**Architecture seeds (§7 of the spec) is optional.** Include only when system-level data flow or threat model is non-trivial and not adequately captured by per-slice diagrams.

## Step 8: Closure loop — grill with corpus context

Synthesis is not one-shot. Classify each unknown:

- *Checkable in-session* — user can answer, web verification resolves, or `search_facts` finds it.
- *Genuinely external* — needs another stakeholder, more data, or compliance review.

**Walk the design tree, root-first.** Unknowns have dependencies — persistence choice determines pagination model; tenancy choice determines authorization scheme; architectural style determines module boundaries; tech stack determines deploy mechanics. Sketch the dependency graph; resolve roots before leaves. Pagination model is wasted air if the persistence layer is still open.

Resolve checkable unknowns **before** writing the spec. Apply these **named techniques** — each callable mid-conversation by name (both you and the user can say *"apply Failure-Mode Probe to slice 5.3"* and the loop runs that specific move):

- **Anchor every question in specific corpus material**; never *"any concerns?"*.
- **Vagueness Press.** *"We'd handle errors gracefully"* → *"Which errors? Returned how? Logged where?"* Hedges get pressed for specifics; spec-ready-ish is not spec-ready.
- **Contradiction Surface.** *"Earlier you said X. Now Y. Which goes in the spec?"* Name the conflict; don't smooth it.
- **Failure-Mode Probe.** Invent specific failure scenarios. *"What happens when the bot dispatch fails partway through? When two users hit submit at once? When the third-party API returns 503?"* Failure modes decide architecture; happy-path elicitation hides them.
- **Rollback Probe.** For hard-to-reverse decisions, ask the rollback cost. *"If this is wrong, what's the cost of undoing it?"* Shapes how hard to grill.
- **Canonical-Term Proposal.** *"You said 'account' — do you mean Customer or User? They're different things."* Fuzzy terms don't survive into the spec.
- **Brainstorm Probe.** When an unknown has multiple genuinely plausible answers and corpus + research can't narrow them down, invoke `/anthara:brainstorm` via the `Skill` tool with the focused sub-question as topic and `caller=spec-writer` as a hint. Brainstorm explores options interactively in the *same* conversation; control returns to spec-writer with the chosen direction already in context — no file written. Use sparingly: only when the question is genuinely open-ended, not when the corpus has the answer.
- **Research to reduce assumption.** When the spec touches an external API, platform, or standard, verify the specifics with `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` before writing. The goal is a solid spec, not a plausible one. Anything that cannot be verified in this session moves to §9 Open questions — do not check unverified claims into the spec.
- One open question per turn. Tone: research partner, not adversary.
- Exit cleanly on stop / defer / park. Deferred items go in Open Questions; do not re-ask.

## Step 9: Choose storage destination

Use `AskUserQuestion`. Offer destinations whose MCPs are connected:

- Local markdown file (default `spec-<short-slug>.md` in cwd)
- Confluence page (Atlassian MCP)
- Notion page (Notion MCP)
- Google Doc (Google Workspace MCP)

If a remote discovery brief was the entry point, default to the same system.

## Step 10: Write the spec

Read `references/canonical-spec-skeleton.md` and use it verbatim. After writing, call `add_shared_memory()` with a brief summary of the spec's location so future Anthara commands find it via `search_facts`.

## Step 11: Hand off

Tell the user: the spec location, what's next in the chain (`/anthara:create-ticket`, `/anthara:develop`), and that anyone can run `/anthara:spec-writer` against this spec later to revise or extend. Do not pronounce the spec ready — the user owns that call.

**Greenfield-first-spec only — offer to extract `ARCHITECTURE.md`.** When the architecture state detected in Step 3 was *greenfield* and §7 was just decided from scratch, ask via `AskUserQuestion`: *"Extract §7 into a standalone `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the repo root? Future Anthara commands (spec-writer, develop, review) will read it as the project-wide architectural reference."* Options: *Yes — extract now / Yes, but at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` instead / Not yet*.

If yes, read `references/architecture-md-schema.md` and write `ARCHITECTURE.md` using §7 as the seed expanded into that schema.

**Brownfield without architecture doc.** If §7 captured a de-facto style that wasn't previously documented, also offer the extraction — same `AskUserQuestion`. Materializing `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the cleanest way to formalize tribal knowledge.

## Canonical spec skeleton

The skeleton lives at `references/canonical-spec-skeleton.md`. Read it at write time (Step 10); use verbatim. Section order is fixed there.

## Use this when / not when, vs other skills

Use this skill when there's a framed problem — a discovery brief, a focused conversation, or an existing spec to revise — that needs decomposition into vertical, externally-testable slices with named invariants, pack-derived NFRs, and a named architectural style.

- **Not for exploring a problem space at session start.** When the direction is unclear up front, run `/anthara:brainstorm` first. When ambiguity emerges *mid-spec*, spec-writer handles it dynamically via the **Brainstorm Probe** (Step 8) — pauses, invokes brainstorm in the same conversation context, resumes once a direction lands. Not punted to §11.
- **Not for synthesizing scattered research.** When inputs are scattered across stakeholders, run `/anthara:discovery` first to build the source-attributed brief that grounds the spec.
- **Not for executing the spec.** Spec-writer produces the spec; `/anthara:develop` turns it into code slice-by-slice.

## What NOT to do

- Do not write vague acceptance criteria. *"Handles errors gracefully"* is not testable; *"Returns 422 with a `{code, message}` body listing each invalid field"* is.
- Do not skip pack-derived NFR elicitation. The user will not think of these — surfacing them is the skill's job.
- Do not declare the spec ready. The user owns that call.
- Do not write *"Not spec-ready"* for unknowns the closure loop could have resolved.
- Do not write prose where a diagram would be clearer; do not write both for the same idea.
- Do not leave the architectural style implicit. §7 must name a recognized style (modular monolith, serverless, hexagonal, event-driven, etc.) and justify it. A spec without a named style has deferred the decision to whoever writes the first module.
- Do not conflate architecture with flow. Sequence diagrams, data flow, and RLS predicates describe runtime behavior; architecture is the structural style that determines coupling and dependency direction. Both belong in §7, but they are different things and the style must be stated first.
- Do not skip tech-stack elicitation on greenfield. Tech and architecture are coupled — Supabase + edge functions naturally ⇒ serverless; NestJS naturally ⇒ modular monolith. Recommending an architecture without knowing the stack is hand-waving.
- Do not skip the feature-level layout probe when the feature touches UI, even if `design.md` exists. Design system is system-level; layout is feature-level. Inheriting tokens does not exempt the skill from probing layout.
- Do not skip the implementation-approach probe. Architecture (style) and implementation (per-feature mechanics: pagination model, real-time mechanism, state management, form handling, background work) are different decisions. Both need explicit answers before slice writing.
- Do not write the spec without confirming slice order. `/anthara:develop` executes slices strictly in spec order; the order is the build sequence. The proposed order is the topo-sort of the surface-DAG (Reachability lines drive it); surface it via `AskUserQuestion` before the canonical skeleton is written.
- Do not write a slice without a Reachability line. Every slice needs at least one `<Host> → <Entry>` line — the first slices use `root` on the left. A slice without Reachability cannot be ordered, and `/anthara:develop`'s integration reviewer has nothing to check the Host → Entry path against.
- Do not let slice prose forward-reference a later slice. Patterns like *"see slice 5.X"* where 5.X comes after the current slice are the textual fingerprint of a missing Host dependency — either reorder so the referenced slice comes first, or reword to remove the reference.
- Do not embed logic-level code in the spec. Indicative shapes (API contract, JSON payload, type signature) only. Function bodies, database queries, control flow are out of scope here.
